<h1>About my JEE prep and a little bit of Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Nitish Kumar, and I passed 12th standard last year. Currently, I’m in my drop year. I took a year off to prepare for the 
  JEE entrance exam. However, after a lot of disappointment, I’ve given up on the plan to clear JEE and get into an NIT or IIT. I tried
   to get back on track with JEE prep many times, but it didn’t work out. No matter how much I tried, I still couldn’t understand the 
   logic behind solving physics questions. I realized that it’s just not for me. Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing because my parents also
    wanted me to clear JEE, and even my best friend Rudra wanted me to clear JEE so that we could get into the same NIT and grind our 
    way through the next 4 years. But I just can't. It didn’t work out. I feel like I’ve let everyone down — I’ve let myself down, I’ve
     let my potential down. But what can I do? I don’t know where I’m going to end up in the next 3 years or so. I don’t know whether
      I’ll be able to make my dad, my dadi, and my bua proud, or whether I’ll be able to be a good friend. I don’t know where life will
       take me. And I’m so afraid. I want to help loads of people. I feel like God has sent me to be a part of everyone’s dark side,
        and I want to help lighten it. I don’t know what I’m saying or what this feeling inside me is, but it pushes me to work hard. 
        But sometimes, it hurts too much. It makes my body shake, makes me numb, anxious, insecure — and who knows what else.
         But still, I don’t want to share this dark side of me in detail with anyone. I’ll face it all by myself.
</p>

<p>With all this going inside my head, I switched my focus to gaining some skills rather than just clearing JEE because I'm not going 
  to an NIT or IIT, that's for sure.But I'm also not going to any well-reputed private college. The bank allows us to take a loan of 7.5
   lakhs, but the fees of the most well-reputed private colleges will sum up to almost 20 lakhs. If we want to take a loan of more than
    7.5 lakhs, we have to provide some collateral to the bank. We don’t have any collateral at the moment, so going to a well-reputed 
    private college is not possible. Also, if somehow we do get a loan of 15-16 lakhs, and if I die after completing the course before 
    repaying the loan, they will seize everything from my dad. I can’t let that happen, so going to a well-reputed private college is 
    truly impossible.

  So, I've decided that I would take a college through OJEE counseling, as I live in Odisha. Through this counseling, we can get 
  colleges at a very affordable price, even with a low rank. I'm sharpening my skills as much as I can before I join college. I 
  can’t tolerate this trauma, anxiety, and all this stuff anymore. I will work extremely hard at a 10th-tier college. I will give
   everything I have to earn as soon as possible so that I can help my dad financially and reduce his stress. I want to improve my 
   dressing sense, I want to have snacks in the evening, and I want to eat my favorite food whenever I want. For this, I will work 
   as hard as I can. I want to help everyone I love. Whenever I go outside, I feel sad seeing some people, and I want to help them 
   financially too. I want to give employment to at least five people before I die. We don’t know how much people suffer. We can’t 
   even relate to their pain, and I don’t want to write any more because my emotional ass is about to make me cry. See you all in 
   the next para after 30 minutes.

<p>These last three years have been very tough for me academically. I joined Axis Coaching to prepare for JEE after getting 91% in
   my 10th board exams. But when school reopened, it became really hard to manage both school and coaching. It was difficult to find
    time for self-study. I used to wake up at 5 a.m., and my school bus would pick me up at 5:55 a.m. I would return from school at
     1:45 p.m., and by 3 p.m., I’d be mentally refreshed. Then, around 4 p.m., the van would pick me up for coaching, and I’d return
      home by 9:30 p.m. So, it wasn't going too well. I argued a lot with my parents because I wanted to leave my school and join a
       dummy school instead. My school was very strict, and with coaching, it felt like I was attending two different schools. Finally,
        after three months, I left the coaching, and my parents asked me to solely focus on the boards. Also the coaching was way too 
        horrible, the owner of that coaching institute was our chemistry teacher but more than teaching chemistry he used to crack
         double meaning joke and flirt with the girls. So, I joined two tuitions forPhysics and Math. A month later, I left the Physics
          tuition because the teacher wasn't teaching according to my school syllabus. Two months later, I left the Math tuition 
          because most days, the teacher would arrive half an hour or even an hour late.

  At this point, I started studying from YouTube. This is when I met Rudra. He asked me what I was doing, and I told him everything. 
  I wished him good luck for JEE, and suddenly he texted me, asking why I didn’t prepare with him. He told me that if he could do it,
   I could do it too. So, I switched back to preparing for JEE. We tried covering our backlogs. I joined the Apni Kaksha online batch
    in 12th to prepare for JEE, while he was preparing through Unacademy. We became really good friends and even the "charmers" of our
     school. We would go to school together and sometimes stay absent on the same days. Things continued like this until our January 
     attempt, when we both did poorly. Then came the boards... Honestly, I didn’t study at all. There was so much going on in my head. 
     My board percentage didn’t even reach 75% (including Math), although my overall percentage was 79.8% (excluding Math). We actually
      had six subjects. Rudra’s board percentage also didn’t reach 75%. We also gave the COMEDK exam, hoping to get a college in 
      Bangalore. But after weeks of discussion, we came to the conclusion that we should take a drop year. We both applied for 
      improvement exams (I in Math and Rudra in Chemistry) to try to reach 75% in PCM. Before taking the COMEDK, I was very certain I
       would get into a college. I never wanted to take a drop year. But then, no one supported that decision, not even my parents, who 
       wanted me to take a drop year. We also had financial issues at the time, so now I’m surviving my drop year.

  It feels like my life has been stuck in a moment for the past three years. Only my age is increasing, but I don’t feel like I am.
   I’m not a social person, and I don’t have friends near my house, so I mostly stay inside the four walls of my room. I have a couple
    of good friends, but they all live far away. With career tension and some personal issues that I can't share here, my mental state
   has deteriorated to the point that I can’t even explain.
